I wanted to learn basic web development and learn more about what it takes to design a website,
So I took the time over my second Co-op Term to work on a personal
portfolio website. Using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript, I made something that
I am personally very proud of. 

I used the following tutorial to help guide me and then added my inspiration to make it my own.
Including changes to the website's functionality, style choices, and other added features.
