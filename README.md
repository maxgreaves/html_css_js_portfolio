I wanted to learn basic web development and learn more about what it takes to design a website,
So I took the time I was able to over the course of my second Co-op Term to work on a personal
portfolio website. Using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript, I made something that
I am personally very proud of. 

I used this following tutorial to help guide me, and then added my own inspiration to make it my own.
Including changes to the functionality of the website, style choices, and other added features.
